The purpose of the project is to demonstrate a professional report using software such as: Visual Studio/Atom, R, and GitHub. It focuses on communication and management with other groups within the class.

This had resulted in many relief programs being active. Nevertheless, 20 million households did not have enough to eat and 10 million being behing in house payments. The [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf)] recorded the changes in major worker groups in September:

> Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for Hispanics decreased to 3.8 percent in September. The jobless rates for adult men (3.3 percent), adult women (3.1 percent), teenagers (11.4
percent), Whites (3.1 percent), Blacks (5.8 percent), and Asians (2.5 percent) showed little change over the month
